Object Pooler
Dylan Boswell and Carter Bourne

Collaboration was rough and the project is currently incomplete, but both partners put in maximum effort.
The scripts work until it comes time to reload, at which point it is unable to do so

shoot controls and object pooler should be applied to snek
shootbullet should be applied to every bullet gameobject
any mention of player should be given the player character
at least eight bullet gameobjects must be present in the scene and assigned to the different slots in the array
